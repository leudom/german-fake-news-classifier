german_fake_news_classifier
==============================

This repo is about classifying german news/fake-news. The objective is to train a binary classifier that is capable of classifying news articles into fake and non-fake. This repo provides a stack for
* Experiments and Collaboration (Dagshub - https://dagshub.com/leudom/german-fake-news-classifier)
* Model and Data Versioning (dvc)
* ML Pipelines (dvc)
* Deployment of Endpoints in Azure (Azure ML)

All those functionalities are provided in a template-wise manner for you in order to to kick-off your own project or - even better - contribute to this repo ;-)
